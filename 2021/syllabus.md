### Prerequisites

The official prerequisite **courses** for CSCI 1230 are CSCI 0150/0160, CSCI 0170/0180, or CSCI 0190.

CSCI 0330, because it uses C, can be helpful but not strictly required. CSCI 0320, for its software design, is additionally helpful but not required. Some familiarity with C++ will be helpful, but help sessions, gear ups, and extra support will be offered to students who don't have any prior C++ experience. Most students take the class without any prior C++ experience. Some knowledge of basic linear algebra (i.e., vector and matrix multiplication, dot and cross products) may also be helpful, but none is required or assumed.

There are some **software and infrastructure prerequisites** as well:
* You need to be able to access Github, esp. Github classroom.
* You need to be able to compile and run the course projects on your own computer, or have a *very*
fast internet connection to the department machines. Most laptop computers post-2015 should have no problem with compiling and running projects. More specifically, we use OpenGL 4.0 for many of our projects, which is supported on Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA graphics hardware that most common computers have newer than 2012.
* You need at least 3GB of space on your machine to dedicate to CSCI 1230.
